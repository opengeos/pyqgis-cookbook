    "The Map canvas widget is probably the most important widget within QGIS because\n",
    "it shows the map composed from overlaid map layers and allows interaction with\n",
    "the map and layers. The canvas always shows a part of the map defined by the\n",
    "current canvas extent. The interaction is done through the use of **map tools**:\n",
    "there are tools for panning, zooming, identifying layers, measuring, vector\n",
    "editing and others. Similar to other graphics programs, there is always one\n",
    "tool active and the user can switch between the available tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map canvas is implemented with the `QgsMapCanvas `\n",

    "displayed on the canvas. The `QgsMapCanvas ` class also controls refreshing\n",
    "of the rendered map. Besides this item which acts as a background, there may be more **map canvas items**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical map canvas items are rubber bands (used for measuring, vector editing\n",

    "creates a rubber band canvas item that shows the current shape of the polygon.\n",
