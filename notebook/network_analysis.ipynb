    "The network analysis library can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create mathematical graph from geographical data (polyline vector layers)\n",
    "* implement basic methods from graph theory (currently only Dijkstra's algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a typical use case can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. create graph from geodata (usually polyline vector layer)\n",
    "#. run graph analysis\n",

    "that is to convert a vector layer into a graph.\n",
    "All further actions will use this graph, not the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a source we can use any polyline vector layer. Nodes of the polylines\n",
    "become graph vertexes, and segments of the polylines are graph edges.\n",
    "If several nodes have the same coordinates then they are the same graph vertex.\n",
    "So two lines that have a common node become connected to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, during graph creation it is possible to \"fix\" (\"tie\") to the\n",
    "input vector layer any number of additional points. For each additional\n",
    "point a match will be found --- the closest graph vertex or closest graph edge.\n",
    "In the latter case the edge will be split and a new vertex added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector layer attributes and length of an edge can be used as the properties\n",
    "of an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting from a vector layer to the graph is done using the\n",
    "[Builder ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) programming pattern.\n",
    "A graph is constructed using a so-called Director.\n",
    "There is only one Director for now: :class:`QgsVectorLayerDirector\n",

    "The director sets the basic settings that will be used to construct a graph\n",
    "from a line vector layer, used by the builder to create the graph.\n",
    "Currently, as in the case with the director, only one builder exists:\n",
