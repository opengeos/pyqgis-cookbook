    "There are several ways to use Python in QGIS Desktop\n",

    "* Issue commands in the Python console within QGIS\n",
    "* Create and use plugins\n",

    "## Scripting in the Python Console\n",

    "## Python Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality of QGIS can be extended using plugins.\n",
    "Plugins can be written in Python.\n",
    "The main advantage over C++ plugins is simplicity of\n",
    "distribution (no compiling for each platform) and easier\n",
    "development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many plugins covering various functionality have been written since\n",
    "the introduction of Python support. The plugin installer allows users\n",
    "to easily fetch, upgrade and remove Python plugins.\n",
    "See the [Python Plugins ](https://plugins.qgis.org/) page for more\n",
    "information about plugins and plugin development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating plugins in Python is simple, see *developing_plugins*\n",
    "for detailed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  Python plugins are also available for QGIS server.  See :ref:`server_plugins` for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing Plugins can be used to process data. They are easier to develop,\n",
    "more specific and more lightweight than Python Plugins. *processing_plugin*\n",
    "explains when the use of Processing algorithms is appropiate and how to develop\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Python code when QGIS starts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods to run Python code every time QGIS\n",
    "starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a startup.py script\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting the `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable to an\n",
    "   existing Python file\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Specifying a startup script using the `--code init_qgis.py`\n",
    "   parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The :file:`startup.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time QGIS starts, the user's Python home directory and a list\n",
    "of system paths are searched for a file named `startup.py`. If that file exists, it\n",
    "is executed by the embedded Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path in the user's home directory usually is found under:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux: `.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3`\n",
    "* Windows: `AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\QGIS\\\\QGIS3`\n",
    "* macOS: `Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3`\n",
    "\n",
    "The default system paths depend on the operating system. To find the\n",
    "paths that work for you, open the Python Console and run\n",
    "`QStandardPaths.standardLocations(QStandardPaths.AppDataLocation)`\n",
    "to see the list of default directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `startup.py` script is executed immediately upon initializing\n",
    "python in QGIS, early on in the start of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The PYQGIS_STARTUP environment variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Python code just before QGIS initialization completes by\n",
    "setting the `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable to the path of an\n",
    "existing Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will run before QGIS initialization is complete.\n",
    "This method is very useful for cleaning\n",
    "sys.path, which may have undesireable paths, or for isolating/loading\n",
    "the initial environment without requiring a virtual environment, e.g.\n",
    "homebrew or MacPorts installs on Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ``--code`` parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide custom code to execute as startup parameter\n",
    "to QGIS. To do so, create a python file, for example `qgis_init.py`, to execute and\n",
    "start QGIS from the command line using `qgis --code qgis_init.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code provided via `--code` is executed late in the QGIS initialization\n",
    "phase, after the application components have been loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional arguments for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide additional arguments for your `--code` script or for\n",
    "other python code that is executed, you can use the `--py-args`\n",
    "argument. Any argument coming after `--py-args` and before a\n",
    "`--` arg (if present) will be passed to Python but ignored by\n",
    "the QGIS application itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, `myfile.tif` will be available via\n",
    "`sys.argv` in Python but will not be loaded by QGIS. Whereas\n",
    "`otherfile.tif` will be loaded by QGIS but is not present in\n",
    "`sys.argv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "qgis --code qgis_init.py --py-args myfile.tif -- otherfile.tif\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want access to every command line parameter from within\n",
    "Python, you can use `QCoreApplication.arguments()`"
