    "# QGIS Server and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about QGIS Server, read the *QGIS-Server-manual*.\n",
    "\n",
    "QGIS Server is three different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. QGIS Server library: a library that provides an API for creating OGC web services\n",
    "2. QGIS Server FCGI: a FCGI binary application `qgis_mapserv.fcgi` that\n",
    "   together with a web server implements a set of OGC services (WMS, WFS, WCS etc.)\n",
    "   and OGC APIs (WFS3/OAPIF)\n",
    "3. QGIS Development Server: a development server binary application `qgis_mapserver`\n",
    "   that implements a set of OGC services (WMS, WFS, WCS etc.) and OGC APIs (WFS3/OAPIF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter of the cookbook focuses on the first topic and by explaining the usage of QGIS Server API\n",
    "it shows how it is possible to use Python to extend, enhance or customize the server behavior or how to\n",
    "use the QGIS Server API to embed QGIS server into another application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways you can alter the behavior of QGIS Server or extend its\n",
    "capabilities to offer new custom services or APIs, these are the main scenarios you\n",
    "may face:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EMBEDDING |rarr| Use QGIS Server API from another Python application\n",
    "* STANDALONE |rarr| Run QGIS Server as a standalone WSGI/HTTP service\n",
    "* FILTERS |rarr| Enhance/Customize QGIS Server with filter plugins\n",
    "* SERVICES |rarr| Add a new *SERVICE*\n",
    "* OGC APIs |rarr| Add a new *OGC API*\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding and standalone applications require using the QGIS Server Python API directly from\n",
    "another Python script or application. The remaining options are better suited for when\n",
    "you want to add custom features to a standard QGIS Server binary application (FCGI or\n",
    "development server): in this case you'll need to write a Python plugin for the server\n",
    "application and register your custom filters, services or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server API basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental classes involved in a typical QGIS Server application are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `QgsServer ` the server instance\n",
    "  (typically a single instance for the whole application life)\n",
    "* `QgsServerRequest ` the request object\n",
    "  (typically recreated on each request)\n",
    "* `QgsServer.handleRequest(request, response) `\n",
    "  processes the request and populates the response\n",
    "\n",
    "The QGIS Server FCGI or development server workflow can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "initialize the QgsApplication\n",
    "create the QgsServer\n",
    "the main server loop waits forever for client requests:\n",
    "    for each incoming request:\n",
    "        create a QgsServerRequest request\n",
    "        create a QgsServerResponse response\n",
    "        call QgsServer.handleRequest(request, response)\n",
    "            filter plugins may be executed\n",
    "        send the output to the client\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `QgsServer.handleRequest(request, response) ` method\n",
    "the filter plugins callbacks are called and `QgsServerRequest ` and\n",
    "`QgsServerResponse ` are made available to the plugins through\n",
    "the `QgsServerInterface ` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:**  QGIS server classes are not thread safe, you should always use a multiprocessing  model or containers when building scalable applications based on QGIS Server API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standalone or embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "For standalone server applications or embedding, you will need\n",
    "to use the above mentioned server classes directly, wrapping them up\n",
    "into a web server implementation that manages all the HTTP protocol interactions\n",
    "with the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal example of the QGIS Server API usage (without the HTTP part) follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. this snippet crashes the test runner in the Qt internal\n",
    ".. method QCoreApplicationPrivate::processCommandLineArguments()"

    "## Server plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Server python plugins are loaded once when the QGIS Server application starts\n",
    "and can be used to register filters, services or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a server plugin is very similar to their desktop counterpart,\n",
    "a `QgsServerInterface ` object is made available to\n",

    "\n",
    "I/O filters\n",
    "...........\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O filters can modify the server input and output (the request and the response)\n",
    "of the core services (WMS, WFS etc.) allowing to do any kind of manipulation\n",
    "of the services workflow. It is possible for example to restrict the access to\n",
    "selected layers, to inject an XSL stylesheet to the XML response, to add a\n",
    "watermark to a generated WMS image and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point, you might find useful a quick look to the\n",
    "server plugins API docs .\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filter should implement at least one of three callbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `onRequestReady() `\n",
    "* `onResponseComplete() `\n",
    "* `onSendResponse() `\n",
    "\n",
    "All filters have access to the request/response object\n",
    "(`QgsRequestHandler `)\n",
    "and can manipulate all its properties (input/output) and\n",
    "raise exceptions (while in a quite particular way as we’ll see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "All these methods return a boolean value indicating if the call should be propagated to the subsequent\n",
    "filters. If one of these method returns `False` then the chain stop, otherwise the call will propagate\n",
    "to the next filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the pseudo code showing how the server handles a typical request and when the\n",
    "filter’s callbacks are called:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "for each incoming request:\n",
    "    create GET/POST request handler\n",
    "    pass request to an instance of QgsServerInterface\n",
    "    call onRequestReady filters\n",
    "\n",
    "    if there is not a response:\n",
    "        if SERVICE is WMS/WFS/WCS:\n",
    "            create WMS/WFS/WCS service\n",
    "            call service’s executeRequest\n",
    "                possibly call onSendResponse for each chunk of bytes\n",
    "                sent to the client by a streaming services (WFS)\n",
    "        call onResponseComplete\n",
    "    request handler sends the response to the client\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following paragraphs describe the available callbacks in details.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### onRequestReady\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called when the request is ready: incoming URL and data have been parsed\n",
    "and before entering the core services (WMS, WFS etc.) switch, this is the point\n",
    "where you can manipulate the input and perform actions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* authentication/authorization\n",
    "* redirects\n",
    "* add/remove certain parameters (typenames for example)\n",
    "* raise exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You could even substitute a core service completely by changing **SERVICE**\n",
    "parameter and hence bypassing the core service completely (not that this make\n",
    "much sense though).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### onSendResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called whenever any partial output is flushed from response buffer (i.e to **FCGI** `stdout` \n",
    "if the fcgi server is used) and from there, to the client. \n",
    "This occurs when huge content is streamed (like WFS GetFeature). In this case\n",
    "`onSendResponse() ` may be called multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the response is not streamed, then `onSendResponse() ` will not be called at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all case, the last (or unique) chunk will be sent to client after a call to\n",
    "`onResponseComplete() `.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning `False` will prevent flushing of data to the client. This is desirable when a plugin\n",
    "wants to collect all chunks from a response and examine or change the response in\n",
    "`onResponseComplete() `.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### onResponseComplete\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called once when core services (if hit) finish their process and the\n",
    "request is ready to be sent to the client.\n",
    "As discussed above, this method will be called before the last (or unique) chunk of\n",
    "data is sent to the client. \n",
    "For streaming services, multiple calls to `onSendResponse() ` might have been called.\n",
    "\n",
    "`onResponseComplete() ` is the\n",
    "ideal place to provide new services implementation\n",
    "(WPS or custom services) and to perform direct manipulation of the output coming\n",
    "from core services (for example to add a watermark upon a WMS image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that returning `False` will prevent the next plugins to execute\n",
    "`onResponseComplete() `\n",
    "but, in any case, prevent response to be sent to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Raising exceptions from a plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "Some work has still to be done on this topic: the current implementation can\n",
    "distinguish between handled and unhandled exceptions by setting a\n",
    "`QgsRequestHandler ` property to an\n",
    "instance of QgsMapServiceException,\n",
    "this way the main C++ code can catch handled python exceptions and ignore\n",
    "unhandled exceptions (or better: log them).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach basically works but it is not very \"pythonic\": a better approach\n",
    "would be to raise exceptions from python code and see them bubbling up into C++\n",
    "loop for being handled there.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Writing a server plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "A server plugin is a standard QGIS Python plugin as described in\n",
    "*developing_plugins*, that just provides an additional (or alternative)\n",
    "interface: a typical QGIS desktop plugin has access to QGIS application\n",
    "through the `QgisInterface ` instance, a server\n",
    "plugin has only access to a `QgsServerInterface `\n",
    "when it is executed within the QGIS Server application context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make QGIS Server aware that a plugin has a server interface, a special\n",
    "metadata entry is needed (in :file:`metadata.txt`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "server=True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**  Only plugins that have the ``server=True`` metadata set will be loaded and executed by QGIS Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [qgis3-server-vagrant ](https://github.com/elpaso/qgis3-server-vagrant/tree/master/resources/web/plugins)\n",
    "example plugin discussed here (with many more) is available on github,\n",
    "a few server plugins are also published in the official [QGIS plugins repository ](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/server).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plugin files\n",
