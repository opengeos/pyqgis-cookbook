    "# IDE settings for writing and debugging plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each programmer has his preferred IDE/Text editor, here are some\n",
    "recommendations for setting up popular IDE's for writing and debugging QGIS\n",
    "Python plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful plugins for writing Python plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Some plugins are convenient when writing Python plugins.\n",
    "From **Plugins --> Manage and Install plugins…**, install:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Plugin reloader*: This will let you reload a plugin and pull new\n",
    "  changes without restarting QGIS.\n",
    "* *First Aid*: This will add a Python console and local debugger\n",
    "  to inspect variables when an exception is raised from a plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** Despite our constant efforts, information beyond this line may not be updated for QGIS 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on configuring your IDE on Linux and Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Linux**, all that usually needs to be done is to add the QGIS library locations\n",
    "to the user's `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. Under most distributions,\n",
    "this can be done by editing `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash-profile` with\n",
    "the following line (tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins:/usr/share/qgis/python\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file and implement the environment settings by using the following\n",
    "shell command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Windows**, you need to make sure that you have the same environment\n",
    "settings and use the same libraries and interpreter as QGIS. The fastest\n",
    "way to do this is to modify the startup batch file of QGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used the OSGeo4W Installer, you can find this under the `bin` folder\n",
    "of your OSGeo4W install. Look for something like\n",
    "`C:\\\\OSGeo4W\\\\bin\\\\qgis-unstable.bat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging using Pyscripter IDE (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "For using [Pyscripter IDE ](https://github.com/pyscripter/pyscripter),\n",
    "here's what you have to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Make a copy of `qgis-unstable.bat` and rename it `pyscripter.bat`.\n",
    "#. Open it in an editor. And remove the last line, the one that starts QGIS.\n",
    "#. Add a line that points to your Pyscripter executable and add the\n",
    "   command line argument that sets the version of Python to be used\n",
    "#. Also add the argument that points to the folder where Pyscripter can\n",
    "   find the Python dll used by QGIS, you can find this under the bin folder\n",
    "   of your OSGeoW install\n",
    "\n",
    "```bat\n",
    "@echo off\n",
    "SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\\OSGeo4W\n",
    "call \"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\"\\bin\\o4w_env.bat\n",
    "call \"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\"\\bin\\gdal16.bat\n",
    "@echo off\n",
    "path %PATH%;%GISBASE%\\bin\n",
    "Start C:\\pyscripter\\pyscripter.exe --python25 --pythondllpath=C:\\OSGeo4W\\bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Now when you double click this batch file it will start Pyscripter, with the\n",
    "   correct path.\n",
    "\n",
    "More popular than Pyscripter, Eclipse is a common choice among developers. In\n",
    "the following section, we will be explaining how to configure it for\n",
    "developing and testing plugins. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging using Eclipse and PyDev\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Eclipse, make sure you have installed the following\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Eclipse ](https://www.eclipse.org)\n",
    "* [Aptana Studio 3 Plugin ](https://www.axway.com/en/aptana) or [PyDev ](https://www.pydev.org)\n",
    "* QGIS 3.x\n",
    "* You may also want to install **Remote Debug**, a QGIS plugin. At the moment\n",
    "  it's still experimental so enable |checkbox| **Experimental plugins**\n",
    "  under **Plugins --> Manage and Install plugins... --> Options**\n",
    "  beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare your environment for using Eclipse in Windows,\n",
    "you should also create a batch file and use it to start Eclipse:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Locate the folder where `qgis_core.dll` resides in. Normally this is\n",
    "   `C:\\\\OSGeo4W\\\\apps\\\\qgis\\\\bin`, but if you compiled your own QGIS\n",
    "   application this is in your build folder in `output/bin/RelWithDebInfo`\n",
    "#. Locate your `eclipse.exe` executable.\n",
    "#. Create the following script and use this to start eclipse when developing\n",
    "   QGIS plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bat\n",
    "call \"C:\\OSGeo4W\\bin\\o4w_env.bat\"\n",
    "set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\qgis_core.dll\\parent\\folder\n",
    "start /B C:\\path\\to\\your\\eclipse.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up Eclipse\n",
    "\n",
    "#. In Eclipse, create a new project. You can select *General Project* and link\n",
    "   your real sources later on, so it does not really matter where you place\n",
    "   this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eclipse project](img/eclipsenewproject.png)\n",
    "*Eclipse project*\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Right-click your new project and choose **New --> Folder**.\n",
    "#. Click **Advanced** and choose :guilabel:`Link to alternate location\n",
    "   (Linked Folder)`. In case you already have sources you want to debug, choose\n",
    "   these. In case you don't, create a folder as it was already explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the view **Project Explorer**, your source tree pops up and you\n",
    "can start working with the code. You already have syntax highlighting and all\n",
    "the other powerful IDE tools available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the debugger working:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Switch to the Debug perspective in Eclipse\n",
    "   (**Window --> Open Perspective --> Other --> Debug**).\n",
    "#. start the PyDev debug server by choosing :menuselection:`PyDev --> Start\n",
    "   Debug Server`.\n",
    "#. Eclipse is now waiting for a connection from QGIS to its debug server and\n",
    "   when QGIS connects to the debug server it will allow it to control the python\n",
    "   scripts. That's exactly what we installed the *Remote Debug* plugin for. So\n",
    "   start QGIS in case you did not already and click the bug symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can set a breakpoint and as soon as the code hits it, execution will\n",
    "stop and you can inspect the current state of your plugin. (The breakpoint is\n",
    "the green dot in the image below, set one by double clicking in the white space\n",
    "left to the line you want the breakpoint to be set).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Breakpoint](img/breakpoint.png)\n",
    "*Breakpoint*\n",
    "\n",
    "A very interesting thing you can make use of now is the debug console. Make\n",
    "sure that the execution is currently stopped at a break point, before you\n",
    "proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Open the Console view (**Window --> Show view**).\n",
    "   It will show the **Debug Server** console which is not very\n",
    "   interesting. But there is a button **Open Console** which lets you\n",
    "   change to a more interesting PyDev Debug Console.\n",
    "#. Click the arrow next to the **Open Console** button and choose\n",
    "   *PyDev Console*. A window opens up to ask you which console you want to start.\n",
    "#. Choose *PyDev Debug Console*. In case its greyed out and tells you to Start\n",
    "   the debugger and select the valid frame, make sure that you've got the remote\n",
    "   debugger attached and are currently on a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyDev Debug Console](img/console-buttons.png)\n",
    "*PyDev Debug Console*\n",
    "\n",
    "You have now an interactive console which lets you test any commands from\n",
    "within the current context. You can manipulate variables or make API calls or\n",
    "whatever you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** A little bit annoying is, that every time you enter a command, the onsole switches back to the Debug Server. To stop this behavior, you can lick the *Pin Console* button when on the Debug Server page and it should emember this decision at least for the current debug session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making eclipse understand the API\n",
    "\n",
    "A very handy feature is to have Eclipse actually know about the QGIS API. This\n",
    "enables it to check your code for typos. But not only this, it also enables\n",
    "Eclipse to help you with autocompletion from the imports to API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, Eclipse parses the QGIS library files and gets all the information\n",
    "out there. The only thing you have to do is to tell Eclipse where to find the\n",
    "libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Click :menuselection:`Window --> Preferences --> PyDev --> Interpreter -->\n",
    "   Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will see your configured python interpreter in the upper part of the\n",
    "   window (at the moment python2.7 for QGIS) and some tabs in the lower part.\n",
    "   The interesting tabs for us are *Libraries* and *Forced Builtins*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyDev Debug Console](img/interpreter-libraries.png)\n",
    "*PyDev Debug Console*\n",
    "\n",
    "#. First open the Libraries tab.\n",
    "#. Add a New Folder and choose the python folder of your QGIS installation.\n",
    "   If you do not know where this folder is (it's not the plugins folder):\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #. Open QGIS\n",
    "   #. Start a python console\n",
    "   #. Enter `qgis`\n",
    "   #. and press Enter. It will show you which QGIS module it uses and its path.\n",
    "   #. Strip the trailing `/qgis/__init__.pyc` from this path and you've got\n",
    "      the path you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. You should also add your plugins folder here (it is in `python/plugins`\n",
    "   under the *user profile <user_profiles>* folder).\n",
    "#. Next jump to the *Forced Builtins* tab, click on *New...* and enter `qgis`.\n",
    "   This will make Eclipse parse the QGIS API. You probably also want Eclipse to\n",
    "   know about the PyQt API. Therefore also add PyQt as forced builtin. That\n",
    "   should probably already be present in your libraries tab.\n",
    "#. Click **OK** and you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Every time the QGIS API changes (e.g. if you're compiling QGIS master and the SIP file changed), you should go back to this page and simply click :guilabel:`Apply`. This will let Eclipse parse all the libraries again.\n",
