    "# Structuring Python Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps for creating a plugin are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. *Idea*: Have an idea about what you want to do with your new QGIS plugin.\n",
    "#. *Setup*: *Create the files for your plugin <plugin_setup>*. Depending on the plugin type,\n",
    "   some are mandatory while others are optional\n",
    "#. *Develop*: *Write the code <plugin_development>* in appropriate files\n",
    "#. *Document*: *Write the plugin documentation <plugin_docs>*\n",
    "#. Optionally: *Translate*: *Translate your plugin <plugin_translation>* into different languages\n",
    "#. *Test*: *Reload your plugin <plugin_reloader_trick>* to check if\n",
    "   everything is OK\n",
    "#. *Publish*: Publish your plugin in QGIS repository or make your own\n",
    "   repository as an \"arsenal\" of personal \"GIS weapons\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** If you wish to update an existing plugin in order to support Qt6 and QGIS 4, lease find instructions in the dedicated wiki <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-be-compatible-with-Qt5-and-Qt6>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to write a new plugin, have a look at the \n",
    "*official_pyqgis_repository*.\n",
    "The source code of existing plugins can help you to learn more about programming. \n",
    "You may also find that a similar plugin already exists and you may be able to \n",
    "extend it or at least build on it to develop your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up plugin file structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with a new plugin, we need to set up the necessary plugin files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two plugin template resources that can help get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For educational purposes or whenever a minimalist approach is desired, the\n",
    "  [minimal plugin template ](https://github.com/wonder-sk/qgis-minimal-plugin)\n",
    "  provides the basic files (skeleton) necessary to create a valid QGIS Python plugin.\n",
    "* For a more fully feature plugin template, the \n",
    "  [Plugin Builder ](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pluginbuilder3/) can create \n",
    "  templates for multiple different plugin types, including features such as \n",
    "  localization (translation) and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical plugin directory includes the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `metadata.txt` - *required* - Contains general info, version, name and some other\n",
    "  metadata used by plugins website and plugin infrastructure.  \n",
    "* `__init__.py` - *required* - The starting point of the plugin. It has to have the\n",
    "  `classFactory` method and may have any other initialisation code.\n",
    "* `mainPlugin.py` - *core code* - The main working code of the plugin. Contains all\n",
    "  the information about the actions of the plugin and the main code.\n",
    "* `form.ui` - *for plugins with custom GUI* -  The GUI created by Qt Designer.\n",
    "* `form.py` - *compiled GUI* - The translation of the form.ui described above to Python.\n",
    "* `resources.qrc` - *optional* - An .xml document created by Qt Designer. Contains\n",
    "  relative paths to resources used in the GUI forms.\n",
    "* `resources.py` - *compiled resources, optional* - The translation of the .qrc file \n",
    "  described above to Python.\n",
    "* `LICENSE` - *required* if plugin is to be published or updated in the \n",
    "  QGIS Plugins Directory, otherwise *optional*. File should be a plain text file \n",
    "  with no file extension in the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:**  If you plan to upload the plugin to the :ref:`official_pyqgis_repository`  you must check that your plugin follows some additional rules, required for  plugin :ref:`official_pyqgis_repository_validation`.\n",
